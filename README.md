## What Is L.A.T.E.?
LATE stands for Language Acquistion Translation Extension. This is a passive way to increase time in front of foreign words naturally. The thought is that it's better to study L.A.T.E. than never!

## Overview

This open source project is designed to help people learn languages faster. For example, I'm learning French which is very different from my first language - English. With this Chrome extension I can define a dictionary of word/translation pairs that I am learning in my French lessons and upload them to the extension. The extension then uses a lightning quick algorithm to scan each webpage and switch every English word pair to the French equivalent right on the webpage! 

## Mockup of Extension

Because I believe design is an important part of building a useful program, I made some mockups of the extension first.

### Dictionary Mode
Using a dictionary either imported from Duolingo or made independently, the extension translates words on the webpage with what you want in real time. This allows you to constantly see words you've already learned increasing your ability to recall them in different contexts.

### Random Mode

This mode randomly translates a certain percentage of words on the page to the language of your choice. It allows you to see a small percentage of new words and identify based on context what they mean. In the settings tab there are also options to show a tool tip with the word translated back if you can't identify the words meaning from context.

### Clear Import & Export Your Dicitonary

You own your data so it is stored locally on your machine and you have total control on importing, exporting and deleting your data. You can even learned words from Duolingo!

## Motivation

For my GeorgiaTech class (Educational Technology) we were asked to come up with a technology that could help the educational community and take a crack at implementing it. This was my attempt at that.
